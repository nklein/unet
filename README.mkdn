# UNet v0.1.2011.03.07

## <a name="overview">Overview</a>

This library builds upon the [USerial library][userial] and
the [IOLib library][iolib] to provide a datagram networking
layer with variable quality of service.  The UNet library
wraps the data given to it so that it can provide the
quality of service desired.  As such, the datagrams generated
by the UNet library are not suitable for interfacing to
non-UNet applications.  If you wish to communicate with an
existing service, you should use the IOLib library and
USerial library directly.

  [userial]: http://nklein.com/software/unet/userial/
  [iolib]:   http://common-lisp.net/project/iolib/

## <a name="recipients">Recipient</a>

If the UNet library is to deliver datagrams, it needs to be told a
hostname and port for each recipient.

    (make-instance 'recipient :hostname "localhost" :port 26354)

A hostname must be specified when creating an instance.  The port, however,
is optional.  If unspecified, the port is assumed to be 26354.
